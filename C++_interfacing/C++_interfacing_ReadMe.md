The C++_intefacing folder contains C++ code equivalent to some scripts in the "series" folder in python. The "interface_ising_C" is a python interface to the code, which takes the output of the ising_C code, processes it to return an array of floats, and plots the array.
It is possible to just download the raw script, run it in an IDE, then run and process the excecutable however you wish, the ising_C.exe file is already supplied in the x64/Debug folder, meaning compilation is not necessary.
