Here's some random media that couldn't fit into the poster

(the rise at T<1 is from domains forming where we get ~2 domains of opposite spin forming instead of a 
fully aligned state, very stable at low temperatures so skews the average
unless you run the simulation for a really long time or add a bit of energy through magnetisation/thermal energy to jumble it up.)

weird other graph you get when you try hysteresis in energy

weird stuff that occurs when you plot mean and variance of energy against size of grid without rescaling the energy to be a proportion of total energy
